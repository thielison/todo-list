# Todo App

This is a Todo app that I created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It allows you to create and manage your tasks in different projects.

# Features

-   You can easily create, edit, and delete projects and todos.
-   Each todo has a title, description, due date, and priority (important or not).
-   You can quickly view all your projects and todos inside them by clicking in the sidebar.
-   You can filter your todos by project, important, due today/this week, completed etc.
-   You can mark your todos as complete or incomplete.
-   Your data is saved in localStorage, so it persists across sessions.

# Technologies

This app is built with modern web technologies, such as:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Webpack
